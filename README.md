# Predicting_Failures_in_Cloud_Servers_Using_Quantum_Machine_Learning.


We will focus on failure prediction in cloud servers using Quantum Machine Learning.
ðŸ’¡ Why?

Cloud companies (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) rely on failure prediction to prevent outages and improve availability.
Classical models are not fast enough to handle large volumes of data in real time.
QML can analyze complex correlations in log data and predict when a server will fail.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective
Develop a QNN that predicts failures in cloud servers based on metrics such as:

CPU usage (%)
Available RAM (GB)
Server temperature (Â°C)
Network latency (ms)
ðŸ›  Technologies used:

PennyLane for the quantum neural network.
Simulated server data for training and evaluation.
GitHub Codespaces to run the project online.


ðŸš€ Project Development
We generated a simulated dataset of server metrics.
We built and trained a QNN on PennyLane.
We evaluated the model's accuracy and predictions.
We prepared the code to be executable on GitHub Codespaces.
